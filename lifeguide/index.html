<h2 id="Mental">Mental:</h2>
<h3>Discipline:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Go outside your comfort zone.</li>
      <li>Perfection is a lack of discipline.</li>
      <li>You have to be okay with things not working out.</li>
      <li>You cannot keep overthinking; you putting negative energy towards whatever it is before it even happens is you tending to the face of it possibly happening, more than the actual possibility of something positive happening.</li>
    </ul>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size:medium;">Leone, Curtis. Self Discipline: <i>Why Self Discipline Is Lacking in Most and How to Unleash It Now.</i> 2016, Accessed 2024. </button>
  <div class="content">
<div id="Self-Discipline Book">
  <p>Do Not Wait to Feel like It, Dump All Your Excuses:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use Mantras - "Mantra refers to a positive suggestion or chant that you create and say repeatedly. When you say something frequently, it influences your mind and thinking pattern thus shaping it in that direction. ... Create a mantra related to self-discipline and a goal that you want to achieve and then chant this mantra day in and day out until you feel that whatever you say is the ultimate truth.
        ... One way of making yourself to remember to say the mantra is to have it printed and a copy placed strategically at literally everywhere you can see it."</li>
      <li>Dump Your Habit of Making Excuses - "You need to discard your unhealthy behavior of making excuses for delaying a task. ... The reason you've been struggling over the years to achieve your goals is probably because you make excuses for not starting. ... If you come up with an excuse, 'I won't go out for a jog now because it's too cold outside', then you need to be honest with yourself and state the real reason of not jogging.
          Tell yourself, 'I am not going jogging because I am extremely lazy and lack the will to do something healthy.' Ouch! Did that sting? Of course, it did. That's what honesty does. It pinches you and makes you realize your wrongs."</li>
    </ul>
  <p>Take Action with your Action Plan:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make Your Action Plan - "You can create a tabular action plan [data presented in tables] or use Excel or MS Word to make one. Find out what steps you need to carry out and in what order they must be performed to do what needs to be done to achieve a certain goal. Make sure to make important columns or sections, such as 'action to be taken', 'time to start the task', 'potential problems you face', 'strategies you can adopt for overcoming your issues', and 'progress report. Next, you need to fill the columns with appropriate content."</li>
      <li>Prepare Yourself to Take Some Action - "If the action plan is not too detailed such that it has the specifics on even the smallest of details, you can get someone to help you come up with ideas for taking action. Get as many ideas on how to take action then decide on the most viable approach. From then on, go on to set a start time i.e. when you want to do whatever it is you need to do."</li>
      <li>Anticipate Potential Issues and Find Strategies to Fix Them - "You need to consider any potential problem(s) that you are likely to face when working on your action plan and devise [plan] strategies that will help you to overcome such problems. For instance, if you worry you'll switch off the alarm when it rings at 5am and drift off to sleep again, then a potential problem could be 'I will probably fall asleep.' Then identify any workable solution that could help you tackle this issue. For instance, you could ask your partner or your roommate to wake you up and ensure that you don't go back to sleep."</li>
      <li>Track Your Progress, Review Your Plan and Make Necessary Changes to It - "You cannot know how well you are doing if you don’t track your progress. This means that you won’t be able to tell whether you are really following your action plan. Therefore, it is important that you make the necessary plans on how to know how well you are performing with regards to following your action plan. For instance, if you wanted to lose weight (say 15 pounds in two months), you will need to determine how often you will weigh yourself to determine your progress. If you notice any flaws in your action plan, this is the best time to fix that. This will increase your chances of following the plan and nurturing your self-discipline."</li>
      <li>Reframe the Mistakes You Make - "You are likely to make a few mistakes, or maybe more in the beginning. But, that’s completely fine. You must not put yourself down, or practice self-hate or self-criticism upon making a mistake.
        You just need to get up, motivate yourself and continue pushing. ... When you discover your mistake, simply take some time to reflect on the mistake as objectively as possible and avoid blaming yourself or criticizing yourself for any wrongdoing. You want to encourage yourself to action not put yourself down for your flaws. Reflect on the positives and the benefits that will come with nurturing self-discipline. This will give you a glimpse of the bigger picture hence increasing your chances of feeling motivated to action as opposed to feeling bad for making mistakes."</li>
    </ul>
  <p>Work on Overcoming Temptations:</p>
  <p>"As you work towards building self-discipline, you should definitely anticipate facing many ‘temptations’. You shouldn’t expect to move from one end to the other end of the spectrum instantly without facing any temptations to go back to the habits that you are so much used to. Here are a few strategies on how to overcome temptations and stay committed to your goal."</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Detach Yourself from the Attractions - "A good tactic to overcome your temptations is to detach yourself from whatever tempts and excites you. For instance, if you are disciplining yourself to stop smoking, you could stop meeting your smoking buddies (people with whom you smoke frequently) for awhile until you have gained complete restraint, or you could stop visiting the spots where you smoked frequently."</li>
      <li>"Mostly, what lures you into giving in to a temptation is the immediate gratification you experience. Unfortunately, the immediate gratification only lasts for a short period and instead leaves you feeling guilty. A useful tactic to overcome your temptations is to always weigh immediate gratification against the long-term consequences of giving in to your temptation. For instance, smoking may give you a sense of satisfaction for a few moments, but the long-term consequences of this habit are severe and include fatal diseases such as lung cancer. One great way of overcoming immediate gratifications is to think about the worst-case scenario for giving in to the temptations."</li>
      <li>Distract Yourself - "Giving too much thought to whatever is tempting you can make it pretty hard for you to overcome it. Don’t think too much about how much you are missing out when you don’t succumb to your temptations. Instead, you need to distract yourself as a way of ensuring you don’t put too much focus on the temptation and what you are missing. Research shows that doing something enjoyable or anything that keeps your mind occupied can help you fight your temptations easily."</li>
      <li>Motivate Yourself - "You need to motivate yourself every step of the way. For instance, whenever you accomplish a certain goal that helps you become more disciplined; you should praise and reward yourself. Make sure that the reward isn’t something you are trying to resist, but is something that encourages you to stay dedicated to your goal."</li>

<h2 id="Body">Body:</h2>
<h3>Vaseline:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#Slugging">Slugging</a> - Refresh Face</li>
    <li>Cuticles - Hydrate - AM & PM</li>
    <li>Lips - After brushing teeth, put vaseline or coconut oil on your toothbrush and brush it on your lips to make them bigger and softer - AM & PM</li>
    <li>Eyebrows - Thicken</li>
    <li>Around Eyes - Eliminate Dark Circles and Eye Bags - PM</li>
    <li>Before fragrance - Longer Lasting</li>
    <li>Wounds</li>
  </ul>

<br>

<h3>Use a sugar scrub:</h3>
  <p> A sugar scrub is a skin care product used after washing the body to exfoliate the skin, remove dead skin cells, and promote skin renewal. It creates smoother, softer, and brighter skin. It can even help your skin tone look more even.
    It also helps you absorb moisturizer better.
  </p>
  <p>Take into consideration:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Most of the dust (90%) in your home is dead skin cells since your whole body is covered with them.</li>
      <li>Using natural scrubs without chemicals is the healthiest alternative for your skin.</li>
      <li>Salt scrubs from the Dead Sea contain minerals that further help the skin.</li>
      <li>Many natural scrubs have anti-bacterial properties that may help with acne.</li>
      <li>Scrubs containing coffee grounds not only exfoliate, the caffeine also helps reduce puffiness and inflammation.</li>
      <li> Over-exfoliating may cause irritation so not only the type of scrub is important but also how it is applied.</li>
      <li>Exfoliating more than 2-3 times per week is not only irritating but may strip skin of natural oils and lead to breakouts.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<br>
    
<div>
<h2 id="Face">Face:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid rubbing your eyes or sleeping on your face, which can damage both your eyebrows and eyelashes. Even avoid touching your face at all. It can lead to bacteria build up and cause acne. To help, try to notice every time you touch your face.</li>
      <li>Collage closes pores by holding the oil in your face.</li>
    </ul>

<br>

<h3>Skincare Routine:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Don't be aggressive when washing your face.</li>
      <li>Don't forget to apply sunscreen! UV Rays literally cause wrinkles.</li>
      <li>Exfoliate - Study's show that exfoliating regularly (twice a week) can help to improve the texture and tone of the skin by up to 75%. It also can lead to a 50% reduction in breakouts by preventing pores from clogging.</li>
      <li>When you use a face scrub exfoliator, it <i>is</i> your cleanser.</li>
      <li>If you used water resistant sunscreen and/or water resistant makeup, you NEED to double cleanse. Your normal cleanser and then one oil cleanser or micellar water</li>
      <li id="Slugging">Slug once a week - Put on vaseline after your moisturizer and then put on nothing else. Make sure you only used a cleanser, toner, and a moisturizer the day you slug.</li>
      <li>Eye creams that are just little moisturizers are a waste of your money. When looking for eye creams to treat under eye bags, look for specific ingredients targeting individual concerns, such as caffeine for puffiness and retinol & matrixyl for wrinkles. </li>
      <li>Go from strong cleansers in the summer to gentle cleansers in the winter.</li>
    </ul>

<br>

<h3>Acne:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Don’t try to pop your pimple - Avoid touching or picking at your face.</li>
      <li>Skip home remedies, like toothpaste, hydrogen peroxide, and rubbing alcohol.</li>
      <li>Retinol, Niacinamide, Green Tea, L-Carnitine, and Azelaic Acid can all help control oil production.</li>
      <li>Perlite and Silica absorb oil from the skin.</li>
      <li>Retinoids and Salicylic Acid remove dead skin cells.</li>
      <li>Retinoids and Glycolic Acid strengthen the pore structure.</li>
      <li>To calm down a pimple, apply ice wrapped in a cloth and press it against the pimple for 3-4 min at a time. Repeat throughout the day.</li>
      <li>Place a clean warm wet washcloth on an infected/yellow pimple for about 10 min at a time. Repeat throughout the day.</li>
      <li>Wash your face with water after exercising/working out.</li>
    </ul>

<br>

<h3>Honey:</h3>
  <p>Honey has intensive hydrating properties, promoting elasticity and firmness. It exfoliates dry skin gently.</p>
  <p>Take into consideration:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Most moisturizers have lots of synthetic chemical products inside them, which surely isn't very healthy. While honey is all-natural.</li>
      <li>Honey contains enzymes that allow moisture to get deep in the skin, bringing much-needed hydration to the deeper layers.</li>
      <li>Leave honey on the face for about 10 minutes.</li>
    </ul>

<br>

<h3>Jawline:</h3>
  <p><b>Exercises:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Jaw Clenches: Clench your jaw muscles tightly for a few seconds and then release. Repeat this several times a day to strengthen your jawline.</li>
      <li>Neck Resistance: Place your hand on your forehead and push your head against your hand without moving your neck.</li>
      <li>Zygopulling: Take your thumbs and put them in the very edge part of your palate in between your teeth and your cheeks just behind your cheekbones. Then massage upwards and outwards. This is used to loosen up your fascia and get you ready for thumbpulling.</li>
      <li>Chintucking: Stand/Sit up nice and straight against something behind you like a chair or a wall. Push your shoulders out and get your neck straight and have every part of your body touching the wall/chair other than your heels. Your heels should be slightly pushed forward. Now, don't move your neck, just hinge it. Hinge your chin towards your neck and give yourself as many double chins as possible.</li>
      <li>Thumbpulling: Put your hands spread apart with your thumbs sticking out and put your thumbs behind your lateral incisors. Not touching your teeth, just on your palate. Then push up and outwards with your thumbs. Like this:</li>
      <img src="thumb.jpeg">
      <li>THE ULTIMATE: Do Zygopulling and then combine Chintucking and Thumbpulling together. Here's the key when doing Chintucking x Thumbpulling, resist downwards with your chin and at the same time push upwards and outwards with your thumbs. Hold for 30 seconds once every hour of the day if you can. Like this:</li>
      <img src="chin x thumb.jpeg">
    </ul>

<br>

  <p><b>Gum:</b></p>
  <p>It's important to take into consideration that even during breaks from chewing, your jaw muscles will still receive some level of stimulation from everyday activities. Therefore, you're unlikely to experience a significant loss of gains during these periods of rest. I suggest having 1-2 month breaks between your chewing periods to ensure the best muscle recovery and ongoing progress.</p>

<h3>Eyes:</h3>
  <p><b>Eyelid Skin:</b></p>
  <p>The skin around your eyelids is delicate and requires special care to maintain its health and appearance.</p>
  <p>Hydration:</p>
  <p>Keeping your eyelid skin hydrated is very important. Use lightweight, hydrating eye creams that provide moisture without causing puffiness. Look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid and peptides, which can help maintain skin elasticity and smoothness.</p>
  <p>Protection:</p>
  <p>The skin around the eyes is thinner and more prone to damage from environmental factors. Always apply sun protection around the eye area to prevent UV damage. Consider wearing sunglasses to shield your eyes from harmful rays and prevent squinting.</p>
  <p>Anti-Aging Treatments:</p>
  <p>To fight signs of aging, consider products that contain retinol or peptides. These ingredients can help reduce fine lines and wrinkles, keeping your eyelid skin looking youthful and vibrant.</p>

<br>

  <p><b>Eye Bags:</b></p>
  <p>Under-eye bags are very common and can make you look tired and older.</p>

<br>

  <p><b>Canthal Tilt:</b></p>
  <p>Positive: A slight positive tilt is ideal for men's eyebrows. If your eyebrows lack this, grow them out and reshape them.</p>
  <p> Neutral: A neutral tilt isn't a deal-breaker. You can still grow the top area and reshape them.</p>
  <p>Negative: This is the worst tilt, often due to a droopy end. Shave the arch and droopy part.</p>

<br>

  <p><b>Eyebrow Maintenance:</b></p>
  <p>Shave your eyebrows twice a month to keep them sharp and clean, removing any loose hairs around them. Use a combination of plucking and an eyebrow razor for the best results.</p>
  <p>Plucking vs. Eyebrow Razor:</p>
  <p>Plucking: Offers precision and longer-lasting results since hairs are removed from the root but can be painful and time-consuming.</p>
  <p>Eyebrow Razor: Faster and less painful, good for quick touch-ups, but hair grows back faster and requires more skill for precision.</p>

<h3>Shampoo Usage Method:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Wet your hair with warm, or cool water (preferably cool).</li>
      <li>Apply a quarter-sized amount of shampoo to your hands.</li>
      <li>Rub your hands together to distribute the shampoo.</li>
      <li>Evenly spread the shampoo across the front, middle, back, and sides of your hair. (And above the hairline on your neck)</li>
      <li>Gently massage your scalp with your fingers in all areas.</li>
      <li>Repeat if your scalp is greasy.</li>
      <li>Rinse the shampoo thoroughly with water.</li>
    </ol>

<br>

<h3>Shampoo and Conditioner for Straight Hair:</h3>
  <p>A modest amount of conditioner is preferred, approximately the same size as a dime or nickel, adjusting based on hair length. Focus on applying the conditioner to the mid-length parts of your hair. Avoid directly applying conditioner to the roots, as this can result in an oily scalp and weigh down your hair. Also, consider your hair's dryness when determining the appropriate amount of conditioner to use. If your hair feels dry or brittle, you may benefit from applying a bit more conditioner to provide additional moisture and nourishment.</p>
  <p>Overdoing it: Shampooing daily or more than once every other day.</p>
  <p>Frequency: Shampoo every other day or every two to three days.</p>

<br>

<h3>Coconut Oil:</h3>
  <p>Benefits: Nourishes and strengthens hair, reducing protein loss and enhancing shaft penetration.</p>
  <p>How to Use: Use as a pre-shampoo treatment, massaging onto scalp and hair, leaving for at least 30 minutes before washing.</p>

<h3>T-Shirts:</h3>
  <p>When it comes to T-shirts, the difference between universal fits and traditional styles is obvious. Traditional T-shirts usually follow a one-size-fits-all approach, leading to loose sleeves that may not complement most body types. This generic approach fails to leverage clothing's potential to accentuate one's physical features.</p>
  <p>The perfect T-shirt sleeve should snugly hug the arm. A tighter sleeve doesn't necessarily emphasize weight; instead, it creates a sense of structure and form. For those with a larger build, a fitted sleeve can enhance the appearance of defined arms. Similarly, individuals with a leaner frame can benefit from tight sleeves, which create the illusion of larger arms, adding to a more muscular look. This shows the importance of choosing clothing tailored to the body, rather than relying on generic sizing.</p>

<br>

<h3>Customizing Fit to Your Height:</h3>

<h3>Finding Quality Clothes:</h3>
  <p><b>Online:</b></p>
  <p>While online shopping offers convenience and access to a wide range of brands and styles, our team generally advises against purchasing clothes online, particularly for items where fit and feel are essential. Without the ability to try items on, you're often taking a gamble on how they will interact with your body type. Moreover, the added cost of shipping can make online purchases less economical than they appear.</p>
  <p>However, if you choose to shop online, here are some recommended stores known for their quality and variety:</p>
    <table>

  <p>Despite the allure of online shopping, we recommend prioritizing in-person experiences whenever possible, especially for key wardrobe pieces. Use online resources for research and inspiration but try to visit physical stores to try on clothing before making significant investments. This approach minimizes the risk of disappointment and ensures your wardrobe reflects both quality and personal suitability.</p>

<br>

  <p><b>in Person:</b></p>
  <p>Shopping for clothes in person offers several advantages that online shopping cannot replicate. The most significant benefit is the ability to try on different pieces, ensuring the perfect fit and assessing how the fabric feels against your skin, as well as how the colors complement your complexion. Additionally, in-person shopping tends to be more cost-effective, with no shipping fees and the opportunity for in-store discounts and deals.</p>
  <p>I strongly recommend shopping in person, particularly for essential wardrobe pieces that require a perfect fit or for anyone seeking to curate their style carefully. Direct interaction with the clothing enables a more informed purchase decision.</p>
  <p>For those seeking new clothing, visiting physical stores provides a hands-on shopping experience that online platforms can't replicate. Here are some places where you can discover quality clothing at reasonable prices:</p>

  <p><b>Thrifting:</b></p>
  <p>Thrifting can be immensely satisfying, allowing you to assemble a complete wardrobe, including shoes, for around $300. In some instances, you can put together an entire outfit for under $40, or even score one for under $20 with the right location and a stroke of luck.</p>
  <p>Whether you're browsing traditional retail stores or combing through thrift shop aisles, shopping in person provides the tactile experience of touching, feeling, and trying on clothes before committing to a purchase. This, coupled with the cost-effectiveness and the thrill of discovering hidden treasures, makes it my preferred method for sourcing quality clothing.</p>
  <p>Here are a couple of thrift stores I suggest:</p>

<h3>Color Theory:</h3>
  <p>In the realm of fashion and personal style, color theory often receives an almost reverential treatment, as if the perfect ensemble hinges on meticulously matching hues based on some ancient art. However, the reality is much simpler and more liberating. while color theory can be helpful, it's not the ultimate determinant of dressing well. The key isn't rigidly adhering to complementary colors or fixating on the supposed emotional impact of each shade. Instead, it's about avoiding fundamental mistakes- steering clear of the wrong colors.</p>
  <p>Most colors harmonize well together, and the majority of your wardrobe likely complements each other in ways that color theory enthusiasts might not even consider. The true skill lies not in concocting an outfit like a potion, meticulously balancing exact proportions of blue to counterbalance your yellows, but rather in understanding which colors simply don't mesh well together and why. It's about recognizing those universally acknowledged "never wear these colors together" combinations and steering clear of them.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Blue makes you look more tan.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>Never Wear These Colors:</b></p>

          <td>Bright Yellow</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

<br>

  <p><b>Embrace Neutrals with a Pop of Color:</b> A reliable method for adding color to your outfits is to anchor your look with neutral tones and incorporate one item as a vibrant accent. For instance, pairing black and white shoes with black pants, a red hoodie, and a white shirt achieves a balanced yet visually engaging ensemble.</p>
  <p><b>Opt for Complementary Colors:</b> Pairing two colors that complement each other can instantly elevate your style. For example, combining brown pants, brown shoes, a blue hoodie, and a brown shirt, while more adventurous, still creates a cohesive and appealing appearance. Such combinations work harmoniously, striking a balance without overwhelming the eye.</p>
  <p><b>Avoid Clashing Bold Colors:</b> While mixing bold colors might seem daring, it's essential to avoid combinations that clash. For instance, a mishmash of green shoes, red pants, a blue hoodie, and a white shirt can appear disjointed rather than fashionably bold. Such pairings risk overwhelming the eye and detracting from a well-thought-out ensemble.</p>

<h2 id="Studying">Studying:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Treat each thing you learn like a level up in a video game.</li>
      <li>Use ChatGPT to make questions for you.</li>
      <li>If you have two questions you can then ask the difference between them. Ex: What is a class? What is an object? What is the difference between a class and an object?</li>
      <li>Mix text with pictures in your notes.</li>
      <li>Study your past reviews/exams on that unit.</li>
      <li>Listen to relaxing/jazz music while studying.</li>
      <li>Put most of your effort into the tests that are worth more points.</li>
      <li>A lot of people put questions on the test that were on the review/quiz so remember the questions on them.</li>
      <li>If you lose your train of thought take a 15-second break of just thinking nothing.</li>
      <li>Take deep breaths before studying to “lock in”.</li>
    </ul>
