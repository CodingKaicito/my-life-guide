<h3>Discipline:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Go outside your comfort zone.</li>
      <li>Perfection is a lack of discipline.</li>
      <li>You have to be okay with things not working out.</li>
      <li>You cannot keep overthinking; you putting negative energy towards whatever it is before it even happens is you tending to the face of it possibly happening, more than the actual possibility of something positive happening.</li>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size:medium;">Leone, Curtis. Self Discipline: <i>Why Self Discipline Is Lacking in Most and How to Unleash It Now.</i> 2016, Accessed 2024. </button>
  <div class="content">
<div id="Self-Discipline Book">
  <p>Do Not Wait to Feel like It, Dump All Your Excuses:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use Mantras - "Mantra refers to a positive suggestion or chant that you create and say repeatedly. When you say something frequently, it influences your mind and thinking pattern thus shaping it in that direction. ... Create a mantra related to self-discipline and a goal that you want to achieve and then chant this mantra day in and day out until you feel that whatever you say is the ultimate truth.
        ... One way of making yourself to remember to say the mantra is to have it printed and a copy placed strategically at literally everywhere you can see it."</li>
      <li>Dump Your Habit of Making Excuses - "You need to discard your unhealthy behavior of making excuses for delaying a task. ... The reason you've been struggling over the years to achieve your goals is probably because you make excuses for not starting. ... If you come up with an excuse, 'I won't go out for a jog now because it's too cold outside', then you need to be honest with yourself and state the real reason of not jogging.
          Tell yourself, 'I am not going jogging because I am extremely lazy and lack the will to do something healthy.' Ouch! Did that sting? Of course, it did. That's what honesty does. It pinches you and makes you realize your wrongs."</li>
    </ul>
  <p>Take Action with your Action Plan:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make Your Action Plan - "You can create a tabular action plan [data presented in tables] or use Excel or MS Word to make one. Find out what steps you need to carry out and in what order they must be performed to do what needs to be done to achieve a certain goal. Make sure to make important columns or sections, such as 'action to be taken', 'time to start the task', 'potential problems you face', 'strategies you can adopt for overcoming your issues', and 'progress report. Next, you need to fill the columns with appropriate content."</li>
      <li>Prepare Yourself to Take Some Action - "If the action plan is not too detailed such that it has the specifics on even the smallest of details, you can get someone to help you come up with ideas for taking action. Get as many ideas on how to take action then decide on the most viable approach. From then on, go on to set a start time i.e. when you want to do whatever it is you need to do."</li>
      <li>Anticipate Potential Issues and Find Strategies to Fix Them - "You need to consider any potential problem(s) that you are likely to face when working on your action plan and devise [plan] strategies that will help you to overcome such problems. For instance, if you worry you'll switch off the alarm when it rings at 5am and drift off to sleep again, then a potential problem could be 'I will probably fall asleep.' Then identify any workable solution that could help you tackle this issue. For instance, you could ask your partner or your roommate to wake you up and ensure that you don't go back to sleep."</li>
      <li>Track Your Progress, Review Your Plan and Make Necessary Changes to It - "You cannot know how well you are doing if you don’t track your progress. This means that you won’t be able to tell whether you are really following your action plan. Therefore, it is important that you make the necessary plans on how to know how well you are performing with regards to following your action plan. For instance, if you wanted to lose weight (say 15 pounds in two months), you will need to determine how often you will weigh yourself to determine your progress. If you notice any flaws in your action plan, this is the best time to fix that. This will increase your chances of following the plan and nurturing your self-discipline."</li>
      <li>Reframe the Mistakes You Make - "You are likely to make a few mistakes, or maybe more in the beginning. But, that’s completely fine. You must not put yourself down, or practice self-hate or self-criticism upon making a mistake.
        You just need to get up, motivate yourself and continue pushing. ... When you discover your mistake, simply take some time to reflect on the mistake as objectively as possible and avoid blaming yourself or criticizing yourself for any wrongdoing. You want to encourage yourself to action not put yourself down for your flaws. Reflect on the positives and the benefits that will come with nurturing self-discipline. This will give you a glimpse of the bigger picture hence increasing your chances of feeling motivated to action as opposed to feeling bad for making mistakes."</li>
    </ul>
  <p>Work on Overcoming Temptations:</p>
  <p>"As you work towards building self-discipline, you should definitely anticipate facing many ‘temptations’. You shouldn’t expect to move from one end to the other end of the spectrum instantly without facing any temptations to go back to the habits that you are so much used to. Here are a few strategies on how to overcome temptations and stay committed to your goal."</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Detach Yourself from the Attractions - "A good tactic to overcome your temptations is to detach yourself from whatever tempts and excites you. For instance, if you are disciplining yourself to stop smoking, you could stop meeting your smoking buddies (people with whom you smoke frequently) for awhile until you have gained complete restraint, or you could stop visiting the spots where you smoked frequently."</li>
      <li>"Mostly, what lures you into giving in to a temptation is the immediate gratification you experience. Unfortunately, the immediate gratification only lasts for a short period and instead leaves you feeling guilty. A useful tactic to overcome your temptations is to always weigh immediate gratification against the long-term consequences of giving in to your temptation. For instance, smoking may give you a sense of satisfaction for a few moments, but the long-term consequences of this habit are severe and include fatal diseases such as lung cancer. One great way of overcoming immediate gratifications is to think about the worst-case scenario for giving in to the temptations."</li>
      <li>Distract Yourself - "Giving too much thought to whatever is tempting you can make it pretty hard for you to overcome it. Don’t think too much about how much you are missing out when you don’t succumb to your temptations. Instead, you need to distract yourself as a way of ensuring you don’t put too much focus on the temptation and what you are missing. Research shows that doing something enjoyable or anything that keeps your mind occupied can help you fight your temptations easily."</li>
      <li>Motivate Yourself - "You need to motivate yourself every step of the way. For instance, whenever you accomplish a certain goal that helps you become more disciplined; you should praise and reward yourself. Make sure that the reward isn’t something you are trying to resist, but is something that encourages you to stay dedicated to your goal."</li>

<h3>Eyebrows:</h3>
  <p><b>Eyebrow Maintenance:</b></p>
  <p>Shave your eyebrows twice a month to keep them sharp and clean, removing any loose hairs around them. Use a combination of plucking and an eyebrow razor for the best results.</p>
  <p>Plucking vs. Eyebrow Razor:</p>
  <p>Plucking: Offers precision and longer-lasting results since hairs are removed from the root but can be painful and time-consuming.</p>
  <p>Eyebrow Razor: Faster and less painful, good for quick touch-ups, but hair grows back faster and requires more skill for precision.</p>

<h3>T-Shirts:</h3>
  <p>The perfect T-shirt sleeve should snugly hug the arm. A tighter sleeve doesn't necessarily emphasize weight; instead, it creates a sense of structure and form. For those with a larger build, a fitted sleeve can enhance the appearance of defined arms. Similarly, individuals with a leaner frame can benefit from tight sleeves, which create the illusion of larger arms, adding to a more muscular look. This shows the importance of choosing clothing tailored to the body, rather than relying on generic sizing.</p>

<br>

<h3>Customizing Fit to Your Height:</h3>
  <p>When it comes to fashion, height plays a significant role in how clothes complement your overall appearance.</p>

          <td><b>Fitted Clothing:</b> Opt for clothes that hug your body to highlight your muscular build, especially around the arms and chest.</td>

          <td><b>Shoulder Emphasis:</b> Garments that broaden the shoulders will help balance your proportions, drawing attention away from the midsection.</td>
          <td><b>Showcase Your Arms:</b> Sleeveless tops or fitted sleeves can accentuate arm muscles.</td>

          <td><b>Arm Definition:</b> As with the other body types, focusing on the fit around the arms can significantly enhance your appearance, making your arms look more toned.</td>

<h3>Color Theory:</h3>
  <p>In the realm of fashion and personal style, color theory often receives an almost reverential treatment, as if the perfect ensemble hinges on meticulously matching hues based on some ancient art. However, the reality is much simpler and more liberating. while color theory can be helpful, it's not the ultimate determinant of dressing well. The key isn't rigidly adhering to complementary colors or fixating on the supposed emotional impact of each shade. Instead, it's about avoiding fundamental mistakes- steering clear of the wrong colors.</p>
  <p>Most colors harmonize well together, and the majority of your wardrobe likely complements each other in ways that color theory enthusiasts might not even consider. The true skill lies not in concocting an outfit like a potion, meticulously balancing exact proportions of blue to counterbalance your yellows, but rather in understanding which colors simply don't mesh well together and why. It's about recognizing those universally acknowledged "never wear these colors together" combinations and steering clear of them.</p>

  <p><b>Embrace Neutrals with a Pop of Color:</b> A reliable method for adding color to your outfits is to anchor your look with neutral tones and incorporate one item as a vibrant accent. For instance, pairing black and white shoes with black pants, a red hoodie, and a white shirt achieves a balanced yet visually engaging ensemble.</p>
  <p><b>Opt for Complementary Colors:</b> Pairing two colors that complement each other can instantly elevate your style. For example, combining brown pants, brown shoes, a blue hoodie, and a brown shirt, while more adventurous, still creates a cohesive and appealing appearance. Such combinations work harmoniously, striking a balance without overwhelming the eye.</p>
  <p><b>Avoid Clashing Bold Colors:</b> While mixing bold colors might seem daring, it's essential to avoid combinations that clash. For instance, a mishmash of green shoes, red pants, a blue hoodie, and a white shirt can appear disjointed rather than fashionably bold. Such pairings risk overwhelming the eye and detracting from a well-thought-out ensemble.</p>
